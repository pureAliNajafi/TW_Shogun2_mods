# Shogun 2 Total War - My Mods Collection

A suite of focused, modular mods for Total War: Shogun 2 designed to tailor the campaign experience to my preferred playstyle. Each mod is designed to make a single, clear change to the gameplay.

## Overview

I created these mods to solve specific gameplay quirks I wanted to change. this was an interesting exercise in reverse-engineering game data and logic.

## The Mods

| Cell | Cell |
