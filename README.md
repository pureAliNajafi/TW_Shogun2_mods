# Shogun 2 Total War - My Mods Collection

A suite of focused, modular mods for Total War: Shogun 2 designed to tailor the campaign experience to my preferred playstyle. Each mod is designed to make a single, clear change to the gameplay.

## Overview

I created these mods to solve specific gameplay quirks I wanted to change. this was an interesting exercise in reverse-engineering game data and logic.

## The Mods

| Mod name | Description  | 
|--------|--------|
| [Mighty General Unit](mighty-general-unit/) | Increases the combat stats of the general's bodyguard unit, making them as powerful as hero units. |
| Cell | Cell |
| Cell | Cell | 

## Installation  Usage

1.  Navigate to your Shogun 2 installation directory
2.  Place the downloaded `.pack` file into the `data` folder.
3.  Launch the game and enable the mod in the **Mod Manager**.
    *   If you are not using Steam, you can download a standalone mod manager [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/twmodmanager/).
