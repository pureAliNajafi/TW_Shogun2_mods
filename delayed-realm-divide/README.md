# Delayed Realm Divide

This mod delays the inevitable Realm Divide event by doubling the amount of prestige (fame) a player needs to accumulate before it triggers.

## Overview

It takes double the prestige points to trigger Realm Divide. It doesn't completely remove itâ€”as, in my opinion, the game loses its fun challenge if you can just defeat clans one by one without a major threat. It simply requires more fame. For example, if conquering 15 provinces triggered Realm Divide in vanilla, you will now need the equivalent fame of roughly 30 provinces.

## Design Goal

The intent is to allow for a longer mid-game campaign of expansion and diplomacy, creating larger and more powerful clans before the inevitable endgame crisis of Realm Divide begins. You have more time to build a stronger economic and military base to prepare for the coming storm.

*Note: This mod makes the mid-game longer and more strategic. The endgame challenge of Realm Divide remains, but you will be better prepared for it.*
